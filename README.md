Project Ideas/Proposal for Machine Learning 5367

Hypothetical business scenario: A local startup company of >75 employees that sells fast fashion items is looking to improve their targeted marketing to better tailor their products to the current fashion trends for the next quarter.

Data we are interested in as input: We are interested in data in string format to tag certain words with a sentiment scale, and also gather the most common words surrounding the products that we are interested improving marketing needs.
Data Source: We will access twitter data through an API to gain the most current data based on public tweets to input into our model.
